**Q1- Given a set of words, find all the words with given prefix**

**Q2- Given a set of words, find all the words with given suffix**

**Q3- Given an array of words, convert it into a unique prefix array**

**Q4- Maximum XOR pair**

**Q5- Maximum XOR Subarray**

**Q6- Word Search**

Given a 2D board and a list of words from the dictionary, find all words in the board.

Each word must be constructed from letters of sequentially adjacent cell, where "adjacent" cells are those horizontally or vertically neighboring. The same letter cell may not be used more than once in a word.
