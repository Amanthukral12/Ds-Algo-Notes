## Queue

- First In first Out
- Linear Data Structure

### Operations:

- Enqueue
- Dequeue

**Q1 - Print all binary numbers upto d digits**
Input: 3
Output: 0 1 10 11 100 101 110 111

**Q2- Given some N, and some digits 1, 2...k, find the first N numbers that can be formed from these digits. 

Note: You can do level order traversal (BFS) using queue. 

### Implementation
- Array
  Maintain two pointers: Front and end. 
  Both will point to -1 in the end.

- LinkedList

- Stack ( 2 ways of implementation )

- Implementation of Circular Queue

### Double Ended Queue

- A very powerful data structure
- Implementation of Circular Double Ended Queue
  - Array
    - Have spacial Locality
  - LinkedList
    - Easy to resize
    
**Q3- Given arr[n] and window size k, find max for every window of size k. 

**Q4- Given a stream of characters and we have to find first non repeating character each time a character is inserted to the stream**
**Q5- Shortest Subarray with Sum at Least K**
